Description:
  'A study of inclusive four-jet production in proton-proton collisions at a center-of- mass energy of 13 TeV is presented. The transverse momentum of jets within $| \eta | < 4.7$ reaches down to 35, 30, 25, and 20 GeV for the first, second, third, and fourth lead- ing jet, respectively. Differential cross sections are measured as a function of the jet transverse momentum and pseudorapidity, and of several other observables that ex- ploit angular correlations between the jets. It is found that the measured distributions show sensitivity to different aspects of the underlying event, parton shower, and ma- trix element calculations. In particular, the interplay between decorrelations caused by parton shower and double-parton scattering contributions is shown to be impor- tant. The double-parton scattering contribution is extracted by means of a template fit of distributions for single-parton scattering obtained from Monte Carlo event genera- tors and a double-parton scattering distribution constructed from inclusive single-jet events in data. Values of the effective cross section are calculated and discussed in view of earlier measurements and of their dependence on the models used for the single-parton scattering background.'
