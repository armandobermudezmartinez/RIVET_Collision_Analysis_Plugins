Description:
  'The average total energy as well as its hadronic and
  electromagnetic components are measured with the CMS detector at
  very-forward pseudorapidity, as a function of the charged particle
  multiplicity in the region |eta|<2. Note: this RIVET plugin
  generates results on detector level by applying a final
  forward-folding of a migration matrix provided as part of this
  plugin. This is done to create consistency with the published
  data. To estimate the modelling uncertainty of this approach, it is
  repeated for four variants of the migration matrix, each of which is
  obtained from a full detector Monte Carlo simulation using one of
  the following event generators: PYTHIA 8 tune CUETP8M1,
  PYTHIA 8 tune 4C/MBR, EPOS-LHC, and SIBYLL2.1. Then final 
  result is the average of those
  variations. Model uncertainties can be obtained from the spread of
  the individual results. Read the paper for more information on this
  approach, and the definition of the matrices. '
