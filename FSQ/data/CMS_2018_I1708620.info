Description:
    'A measurement of the energy density in proton-proton collisions
     at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV is presented.
     The data have been recorded with the CMS experiment at the LHC
     during low luminosity operations in 2015. The energy density is
     studied as a function of pseudorapidity in the ranges $-6.6 <
     \eta < -5.2$ and $3.15 < |\eta| < 5.20$. The results are compared
     with the predictions of several models. All the models considered
     suggest a different shape of the pseudorapidity dependence
     compared to that observed in the data.  A comparison with LHC
     proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 0.9$ and 7 TeV
     confirms the compatibility of the data with the hypothesis of
     limiting fragmentation.'
