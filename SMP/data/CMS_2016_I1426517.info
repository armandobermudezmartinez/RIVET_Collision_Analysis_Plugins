Description:
  'The differential cross section and charge asymmetry for inclusive $pp \rightarrow W^{\pm} + X \rightarrow \mu^{\pm}\nu + X$ production at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV are measured as a function of muon pseudorapidity. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 18.8 $fb^{-1}$ recorded with the CMS detector at the LHC. These results provide important constraints on the parton distribution functions of the proton in the range of the Bjorken scaling variable $x$ from $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-1}$.'
