RunInfo:
  8 TeV $pp$ collisions. Events are required to have exactly one muon with
  $\pT > 25$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.1$, and $\MT(\mu,\nu) > 50$ GeV. Jets are required to have
  $\pT > 30$ GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$. Jets are only considered if they are separated from the muon by
  $\Delta R > 0.5$. Muons are dressed with photons in a cone of 0.1 around the muon.

Description:
  'Differential cross sections for a W boson produced in association with jets are measured in a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV recorded with the CMS detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.6 inverse femtobarns. The W bosons are identified through their decay into a muon and a neutrino. The cross sections are reported as functions of jet multiplicity, jet transverse momenta, and the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta ($\HT$) for different jet multiplicities. Distributions of the angular correlations between the jets and the muon are examined, as well as the average number of jets as a function of $\HT$ and as a function of angular variables. The cross sections are measured in the fiducial region defined by a muon with $\pT > 25$ GeV and pseudorapidity $|\eta| < 2.1$, and by a transverse mass between the muon and the missing transverse energy $\MT > 50$ GeV. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-kT algorithm with a distance parameter R = 0.5, and only jets with $pT > 30$ GeV, $|\eta| < 2.4$, and a separation of $\Delta R > 0.5$ from the muon are considered.'
