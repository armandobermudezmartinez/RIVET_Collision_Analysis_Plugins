Description:
  'Differential cross sections for a W boson produced in association with jets are measured in a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded with the CMS detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.2 inverse femtobarns. The W bosons are identified through their decay into a muon and a neutrino. The cross sections are reported as functions of jet multiplicity, jet transverse momenta, jet rapidity $|y|$, the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta ($H_T$), and angular correlations between the muon and each jet for different jet multiplicities. The cross sections are measured in the fiducial region defined by a muon with $p_T > 25$ GeV and pseudorapidity $|\eta| < 2.4$, and by a transverse mass between the muon and the missing transverse energy $M_T > 50$ GeV. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-kT algorithm with a distance parameter R = 0.4, and only jets with $p_T > 30$ GeV, $|y| < 2.4$, and a separation of $\Delta R > 0.4$ from the muon are considered. In addition, the differential cross section is measured as a function of the angular distance (DeltaR) between the muon and the closest jet for events with one or more jets, requiring jets with $p_T > 100$ GeV and the leading jet with $p_T > 300$ GeV.'
