Description:
  'Differential cross section measurements of $\mathrm{W}^{\pm}\gamma$ production in proton-proton collisions at
   $\sqrt{s} = 13\,\mathrm{TeV}$ are presented. The data set used in this study is collected with the CMS detector
   at the CERN LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of $137\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. Candidate events containing
   an electron or muon, a photon, and missing transverse momentum are selected. The measurements are compared to standard
   model predictions computed at next-to-leading order and next-to-next-to-leading order in perturbative quantum
   chromodynamics. Constraints on the presence of heavy new physics affecting the $\mathrm{WW}\gamma$ vertex are determined
   within an effective field theory framework, focusing on the $\mathcal{O}_{3W}$ operator. A simultaneous measurement of
   the photon transverse momentum and the azimuthal angle of the charged lepton in a special reference frame is performed.'
