Description:
  Measurement in the fiducial phase space for $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ production in the all-jet final state of the top quark pair decays.
  No explicit lepton veto or decay channel requirements are applied, so one should use inclusive top quark decays.
  Fiducial phase space is defined as $\geq 8$ jets, of which $\geq 4$ are b jets, with jet $\pT > 20~\GeV$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$.
  Of those jets, at least six are required to have $\pT > 30~\GeV$.
  B jets are defined using ghost-matching of B hadrons with no requirement on hadron $\pT$.
  No requirement is applied on the origin of of the b jets, i.e. the phase space definition is independent from simulated parton content.
