Description:
      'Abstract : 

      Measurements are reported of the normalized differential cross sections for top quark pair production with respect to four kinematic event variables: the missing transverse energy; the scalar sum of the jet transverse momentum (pT); the scalar sum of the pT of all objects in the event; and the pT of leptonically decaying W bosons from top quark decays.

      Rivet : 

	  This analysis is to be run on ${\rm t\bar{t}}$ simulation. 

	  The particle level selection requires:
	  - exactly one electron or muon with $p_{T} > 26$~GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$
	  - no additional electrons or muons with $p_{T} > 15$~GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$
	  - at least thress jets with $p_{T} > 30$~GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$, and one jet with $p_{T} > 25$~GeV and $|\eta| < 2.4$
	  - two of these selected jets must be tagged as originating from a b quark.
