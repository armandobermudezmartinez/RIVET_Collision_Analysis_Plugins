Description:
'Differential cross section measurements of the Z($\rightarrow\mu\mu$) boson production in association with jets are presented, using 13 TeV proton-proton collisions data recorded by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$. The cross sections are presented as a function of the azimuthal separation between the Z and the leading jet ($\Delta\phi_{Z,Jet1}$) as well as the two leading jets ($\Delta\phi_{Jet1,Jet2}$), and as a function of the Z $p_T$. The jet multiplicity as a function of the Z $p_T$, and the transverse momentum $p_T^{bal}$ of the Z+jets system in inclusive 1- and 2-jet events are also presented. The cross section measurements are then compared with the predictions from a leading and next-to-leading order multi-leg Monte Carlo generators.'
