Description:
  'The average total energy as well as its hadronic and electromagnetic components are measured with the CMS detector at
   pseudorapidities of -6.6<eta<-5.2 as a function of the charged particle multiplicity in the region |eta|<2. This measurement is sensitive to correlations
   induced by the underlying event structure over a very wide pseudorapidity region. The predictions of Monte Carlo event generators
   commonly used in collider experiments and ultra-high energy cosmic ray physics are compared to the data.'
