Description:
  'Differential cross section measurements of $\mathrm{W}^{\pm}\gamma$ production in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13\,\mathrm{TeV}$ are presented.
   The data set used in this study was collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2016--2018 with an integrated luminosity of $138\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$.
   Candidate events containing an electron or muon, a photon, and missing transverse momentum are selected.
   The measurements are compared with standard model predictions computed at next-to-leading and next-to-next-to-leading orders in perturbative quantum chromodynamics.
   Constraints on the presence of TeV-scale new physics affecting the $\mathrm{WW}\gamma$ vertex are determined within an effective field theory framework, focusing on the $\mathcal{O}_{3W}$ operator.
   A simultaneous measurement of the photon transverse momentum and the azimuthal angle of the charged lepton in a special reference frame is performed.'
