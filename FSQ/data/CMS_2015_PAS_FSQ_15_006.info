Description:
    'The measurement of forward energy flow in pseudo-rapidity range $3.0<|\eta|<6.6$ using the proton-proton 
    collisions collected in the first LHC Run II operation in 2015 at \sqrt{s} = 13 TeV is presented. 
    The energy flow measurement is performed with zero bias events. The energy flow, $\mathrm{d}E/\mathrm{d}\eta$, 
    as well as the transverse energy density, $\mathrm{d}E_{T}/\mathrm{d}\eta$, are studied as a function of 
    pseudorapidity. The results are compared with models used to describe high-energy hadronic interactions.'
