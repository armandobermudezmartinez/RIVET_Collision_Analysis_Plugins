Description:
  'A study of four jet production in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV is presented. The data sample was collected in 2016 with the CMS detector at the LHC during a low intensity run, with an integrated luminosity of 0.04 pb. Differential cross sections are measured as a function of the jet transverse momentum, pseudorapidity, and several other observables that exploit angular correlations. The
lowest jet transverse momentum cuts required in this paper are 35, 30, 25, and 20 GeV for the 1st, 2nd, 3th, and 4th jet respectively within $|\eta|$ < 4.7. It is found that the data is very sensitive to different aspects of the underlying event, parton showers, and matrix element calculations. In particular the interplay between the decorrelations caused by parton showers and double parton scattering contributions is shown to be important. Models employing angular ordered parton showers, off-shell initial kinematics, as well as models with higher order matrix element calculations provide a better description of the data in certain observables. The $\Delta S$ observable, which characterizes the azimuthal angle between the hard and soft jet pair (calculated with $\pT >$ 50, 30, 30, and 30 GeV for the 1st, 2nd, 3th, and 4th jet respectively), is used to extract a double parton scattering contribution by means of a template fit method. Model dependent values of sigma effective are calculated and compared to previous measurements. While all extracted values of the effective cross section show agreement with measurements performed at lower center-of-energies, a strong model dependence of the double parton scattering contribution is found.'
