Description:
   'This is a measurement of the differential cross sections of inclusive
   and Mueller-Navelet dijet production as a function of the absolute distance in
   rapidity, $\Delta y$, between jets. The ratios of inclusive to exclusive dijet
   production, the Mueller-Navelet to exclusive dijet production,
   as well as the ratios of inclusive to exclusive with veto and
   Mueller-Navelet to exclusive with veto  is also measured.
   These measurements were performed with the CMS
   detector in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 2.76$ TeV for
   jets with $p_T > 35$ GeV and $|y| < 4.7$, with integrated luminosity of
   5.4pb^-1. The measured observables are
   corrected for detector effects.'
